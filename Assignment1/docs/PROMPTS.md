## Prompts Log (paste real prompts here)

Use this focused log to capture the prompts that actually shaped the project. The lecturer wants to see how you phrased things; accuracy of the model’s answers is not graded.

For each entry:

- **Objective** (what you were trying to achieve)
- **Prompt** (paste exact text)
- **Result** (short summary)
- **Change** (what you changed in code/process)
